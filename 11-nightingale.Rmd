## HistData: Data Sets from the History of Statistics and Data Visualization

* **URL**: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HistData/index.html
* **Description**: The 'HistData' package provides a collection of small data sets that are interesting and important in the history of statistics and data visualization. The goal of the package is to make these available, both for instructional use and for historical research. Some of these present interesting challenges for graphics or analysis in R.

### Nightingale Datasets

* **Details**: 
For a given cause of death, D, annual rates per 1000 are calculated as 12 * 1000 * D / Army, rounded to 1 decimal.

The two panels of Nightingale's Coxcomb correspond to dates before and after March 1855

* Format: 
A data frame with 24 observations on the following 10 variables.
* Date: 
a Date, composed as as.Date(paste(Year, Month, 1, sep='-'), "%Y-%b-%d")
* Month: 
Month of the Crimean War, an ordered factor
* Year: 
Year of the Crimean War
* Army: 
Estimated average monthly strength of the British army
* Disease: 
Number of deaths from preventable or mitagable zymotic diseases
* Wounds: 
Number of deaths directly from battle wounds
* Other: 
Number of deaths from other causes
* Disease.rate: 
Annual rate of deaths from preventable or mitagable zymotic diseases, per 1000
* Wounds.rate: 
Annual rate of deaths directly from battle wounds, per 1000
* Other.rate: 
Annual rate of deaths from other causes, per 1000

## Exploratory Data Analysis Using `tidyverse` Package

### Reading Nightingale Data and Glimpse the Structure

```{r}
library(HistData)
library(tidyverse)
data(Nightingale)
Nightingale
glimpse(Nightingale)
```
### Comparison of Death Causes

```{r}
df_cause <- Nightingale %>%
  select(Disease, Wounds, Other) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Cause", values_to = "Death")

df_cause %>% ggplot(aes(x = Cause, y = Death)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```


```{r}
df_cause %>% ggplot(aes(x = "", y = Death, fill = Cause)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + 
  coord_polar("y", start=0)
```
```{r}
total = sum(df_cause$Death)
df_cause %>% 
  group_by(Cause) %>%
  summarize(Rate = round(sum(Death)/total*100, digits = 1))
```

```{r}
df_rate <- Nightingale %>%
  select(Date, Army, Disease, Wounds, Other) %>%
  mutate(Death_Rate = (Disease + Wounds + Other)/Army,
         Disease_Rate = Disease/Army) 

df_rate %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Death_Rate)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = Disease_Rate), color = "blue") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("1855-04-01"), color = "red")
```

### Data Wrangling - Tidying Data

1. First focus on the rates by cause
2. Month, Year columns are redundant and use Date
3. When rates are considered, Army, Desease, Wounds and Other columns are not necessary.
4. We use long table to apply `ggplot2` to visualize data.

```
dat %>% pivot_longer(cols = "columns kept as a vector", names_to = "variable", values_to = "date")
```

```{r}
df_fn <- Nightingale %>%
  select(Date, "Disease_Rate" = Disease.rate, "Wounds_Rate" = Wounds.rate, "Other_Rate" = Other.rate) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Disease_Rate:Other_Rate, names_to = "Cause", values_to = "Deaths")
df_fn
```

```{r}
ggplot(df_fn) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Date, y = Deaths, fill = Cause), stat="identity")
```

Default of the position is "stack". The other options are "dodge" and "identity". The option "identity" is not useful for bars, because it overlaps them. See that overlapping by setting a small value for alpha, transparancy.

```{r}
ggplot(df_fn) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Date, y = Deaths, fill = Cause), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```
```{r}
df_fn %>% filter(Date >= as.Date("1855-08-01")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Date, y = Deaths, fill = Cause), stat = "identity", position = "identity", alpha = 0.4)
```
```{r}
df_fn %>% filter(Date >= as.Date("1855-08-01")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Date, y = Deaths, fill = Cause), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```

Let us split the data into two and see the change before and after the Sanitary Commission arrived  in the middle of the war, i.e, March 6, 1885.

```{r}
df_fn_ba <- df_fn %>% 
  mutate(Regime = if_else(Date < as.Date("1855-04-01"), "Before", "After"))
df_fn_ba %>% filter(Date > as.Date("1855-01-01") & Date < as.Date("1855-06-01"))
```

```{r}
df_fn_ba %>% filter(Regime == "Before") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = as.factor(Date), y=Deaths, fill = Cause), 
           width = 1, position="identity", stat="identity", alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_y_sqrt() +
  coord_polar(start = 3*pi/2) +
  labs(title = "Causes of Mortality in the Army in the East")

df_fn_ba %>% filter(Regime == "After") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = as.factor(Date), y=Deaths, fill = Cause), 
           width = 1, position="identity", stat="identity", alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_y_sqrt() +
  coord_polar(start = 3*pi/2) +
  labs(title = "Causes of Mortality in the Army in the East")
```

Please refer to the folloing code, f you want to use facet_grid. The argument scales = "free" of facet_grid does not support coord_polar. However, if you add the first two lines, it seems to work. See https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2815.

```{r}
cp <- coord_polar(theta = "x", start = 3*pi/2)
cp$is_free <- function() TRUE

df_fn_ba %>% #filter(Regime == "Before") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = as.factor(Date), y=Deaths, fill = Cause), 
           width = 1, position="identity", stat="identity", alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_y_sqrt() + # death scale is proportional to the area
  cp + 
  facet_grid(. ~ Regime, labeller = label_both, scales = "free") + 
  labs(title = "Causes of Mortality in the Army in the East") +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

```{r}
df_fn_before <- df_fn %>% filter(Date < as.Date("1855-04-01"))
nrow(df_fn_before)
df_fn_after <- df_fn %>% filter(Date >= as.Date("1855-04-01"))
nrow(df_fn_after)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df_fn_before) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Date, y = Deaths, fill = Cause), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```
```{r}
ggplot(df_fn_after) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Date, y = Deaths, fill = Cause), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```

### `reshape` Package: Flexibly Reshape Data

* **Description**: Flexibly restructure and aggregate data using just two functions: melt and cast.
* **URL**: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reshape
* **HP of the Author**: http://had.co.nz/reshape/
  - Article: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v021i12
* **Reference Manual**: [reshape.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape/reshape.pdf)


```{r}
# NOT RUN {
library(HistData)
data(Nightingale)

# For some graphs, it is more convenient to reshape death rates to long format
#  keep only Date and death rates
require(reshape)
Night<- Nightingale[,c(1,8:10)]
melted <- melt(Night, "Date")
names(melted) <- c("Date", "Cause", "Deaths")
melted$Cause <- sub("\\.rate", "", melted$Cause)
melted$Regime <- ordered( rep(c(rep('Before', 12), rep('After', 12)), 3), 
                          levels=c('Before', 'After'))
Night <- melted

# subsets, to facilitate separate plotting
Night1 <- subset(Night, Date < as.Date("1855-04-01"))
Night2 <- subset(Night, Date >= as.Date("1855-04-01"))

# sort according to Deaths in decreasing order, so counts are not obscured [thx: Monique Graf]
Night1 <- Night1[order(Night1$Deaths, decreasing=TRUE),]
Night2 <- Night2[order(Night2$Deaths, decreasing=TRUE),]

# merge the two sorted files
Night <- rbind(Night1, Night2)


require(ggplot2)
# Before plot
cxc1 <- ggplot(Night1, aes(x = factor(Date), y=Deaths, fill = Cause)) +
		# do it as a stacked bar chart first
   geom_bar(width = 1, position="identity", stat="identity", color="black") +
		# set scale so area ~ Deaths	
   scale_y_sqrt() 
		# A coxcomb plot = bar chart + polar coordinates
cxc1 + coord_polar(start=3*pi/2) + 
	ggtitle("Causes of Mortality in the Army in the East") + 
	xlab("")

# After plot
cxc2 <- ggplot(Night2, aes(x = factor(Date), y=Deaths, fill = Cause)) +
   geom_bar(width = 1, position="identity", stat="identity", color="black") +
   scale_y_sqrt()
cxc2 + coord_polar(start=3*pi/2) +
	ggtitle("Causes of Mortality in the Army in the East") + 
	xlab("")
```

The following part does not work. Error!

```
# do both together, with faceting
cxc <- ggplot(Night, aes(x = factor(Date), y=Deaths, fill = Cause)) +
 geom_bar(width = 1, position="identity", stat="identity", color="black") + 
 scale_y_sqrt() +
 facet_grid(. ~ Regime, scales="free", labeller=label_both)
 facet_grid(. ~ Regime, labeller=label_both)
cxc + coord_polar(start=3*pi/2) +
	ggtitle("Causes of Mortality in the Army in the East") + 
	xlab("")
```
