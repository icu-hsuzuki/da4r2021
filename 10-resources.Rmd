      - Include codes only when necessary
  * Format: pdf. (Rmd > pdf, Rmd > MS Word > pdf, Rmd > MS Word > Google Doc > pdf)




### R Notebook, MS Word and PDF, Workflow

1. Rmd > pdf: Use knit pdf, one of the knit options you can find under the knit button. 
2. Rmd > MS Word > pdf: Use knit Word, one of the knit options you can find under the knit button. Then, use one of the print options of MS Word to obtain a pdf file. 
3. Rmd > MS Word > Google Doc > pdf: If you do not have MS Word, upload your MS Word file obtained by knit Word into your Google Doc and edit it. You can create and download a PDF file easily using Google Doc. Since you can edit the file as an MS Word file now with Google Doc, you can make the style file mentioned above.

In the following, we focus on the second option and explain how to handle chunks and the MS Word style file.

```
title: "Title of Your Paper"
author: "Your Name"
date: '2021-03-03'
output:
  html_notebook:
    toc: yes
    number_sections: yes
    toc_float: yes
  html_document:

```

### Export MS Word Using a Style File

* Use R Markdown to create a Word document
  - Save as: ``word-styles-reference-01.docx''
* Edit the Word styles you find there\par
  - Edit the styles of file ``word-styles-reference-01.docx'' .
  - e.g. Change the page size: US Letter to A4 Paper
* Save this document as your style reference docx file
* Format an Rmd report using the styles reference docx file

### Edit Chunk Options

#### Before Exporting MS Word Document by knit Word

In the paper, you may want to deal with the following issues.

1. You want to include the chart but not the code.
2. You do not want to show your codes, results, messages, or warnings.
3. You want to adjust the size of the figure to your document.
4. You do not want to include a long table.
5. ... and many more.

### Chunk Options

* include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the chunk code, and other chunks can use the resulting output.
  - You should add this option after you check the code does not have an error. 
* echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. It is a useful way to embed figures.
* message = FALSE prevents messages generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
* warning = FALSE prevents warnings generated by code from appearing in the finished.
  - You should add this option after you check the warnings. You may get errors or unexpected output.
* fig.cap = "..." adds a caption to graphical results.
* fig.height, fig.width: The width and height to use in R for plots created by the chunk (in inches).

### Examples and References

It is a good idea to explain the packages you used but does not need to show everything in your paper as the number of pages is restricted. 

1. You can hide your setting by `include = FALSE`.

2. In HTML, you can include a big table, but in MS Word, you need to control the number of rows to appear. Here I used `slice(1:10)`, a `tidyverse` command corresponding to `head(10)` in base R. 

3. You can include your chart without showing your code by `echo = FALSE`.

### R Studio: Run Codes

There are many ways to run your codes. You can use key bindings as well, I believe. However, before complete editing, your final product, make sure that your code chunks run correctly without error. You need to check this process because, with R Notebook, you can edit back and forth, but to be consistent, your product has to be read consistently from top to bottom. There are many options under the Run button, including Run All and Restart R, and Run All Chunks. I recommend you the following:

1. Restart R and run all chunks.
2. Knit your R Markdown file with the format of the final product.
3. Check the output carefully.

Good luck! See Roundup.nb.html in Moodle
